[09:58, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: Hey
[10:45, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: Got your number from Vishal electronics
[10:45, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: Wanted to talk regarding project
[10:47, 29/12/2022] Shashi: Hi, I'm traveling now in train. I cant talk. Do you have a pdf of project that I can see.
[10:48, 29/12/2022] Shashi: I'm back in Bangalore after a day.
[10:48, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: Ye sure
[10:48, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: https://nevonprojects.com/advanced-footstep-power-generation-system-using-rfid-for-charging/
[10:51, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: RFID part can be skipped
[10:52, 29/12/2022] Shashi: Let me read up a bit . I need to see feasibility first. Doable. ?? I will investigate.
[10:53, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: Yeah sure... Hod is ready to accept only of we show charging through piezoelectric...
[10:56, 29/12/2022] Shashi: What about projects are you thinking of. Go with projects that can be done in short time. I'm working on other project, so give me a day and I will do a due diligence and revert.
[10:56, 29/12/2022] Shashi: How much of the project have you investigated.
[10:56, 29/12/2022] Shashi: Parts. ??
[10:57, 29/12/2022] Shashi: What is the timeline.
[10:57, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: Project idea i have to present within tomorrow
[10:58, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: Project submission in a month
[10:58, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: They are asking for innovative idea... Rejected automatic watering system, remote patient monitoring system...
[10:59, 29/12/2022] Shashi: All colleges are expecting the same. Newer ideas.
[11:00, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: This project is accepted only problem is they aren't sure of voltage output of piezoelectric pad we'll make...
[11:00, 29/12/2022] +91 70731 78377: Although this is mini project for 5th semester.. not major project
[12:44, 30/12/2022] Shashi: Hello,
[12:44, 30/12/2022] Shashi: Do you have a piezo electric sensor ? ( have you purchased it, or have it in the lab )
I want to first see if it will work, I can interface it with the Arduino if you have it.
[12:46, 30/12/2022] Shashi: Im not available tomorrow as I have to work on another.

In lab i have...
but meanwhile I can toggle back and forth
Okay no worries...
Have you interfaced it with Arduino to the Analog porst ?
*port
No i haven't... üòÖ
Do you have spare piezo electric sensor(s) that I can get .
I'll have buy them and then send it to you..
Can we talk over phone in the evening
?
Yes, Call at 4:30.
Im free until 5:30PM
Ohhkay... Sometime around 9 will be okay?
Yes, but let's finish by 9:30 PM or so.
Yeah sure

Yes sir thanks
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1627725864133415/search/?q=heart%20beat
Can you open this ?
Diodes 1N4007 - a few - they are like 5 or 10 rupees.
Yes sir i joined it
https://projecthub.arduino.cc/sadreactonly/fa2bf887-2bcd-4334-b3ce-8ab673d44943
Tomorrow - go over this project and tell me if you were able to follow the code.
If not, no issues - I can help.
Yes sir..
Dupont connectors
- Male to Male
- Male to F
Female to Male -
a strip each.
buy a strip thats usually 40 each.
Okay sir
This is what we presented
Also, get 1 box of varied resistors. ( about 40 rupees or something, will have assorted range of R)
Get the Arduino as well.
Ohhkay sir
Sir voltage was b/w
1-3 volts
In voltmeter
Send me a 2 sec video, or a photo of your project.
Good to hear progress.
Now connect 2 units and tell me
Third step is to see if you can lift up an LED.
Sir i am facing problem in soldering, it's coming out
Yes sir
Do it slowly.  I'm happy that you are doing it on a day where you are supposed to be outside preparing for NY celebrations.  That's good.
Hard work pays off. So do it carefully. It takes multiple tries and lots of failures.
Dont give up.
Yes sir ‚úåÔ∏èüòÅ
Are you using this when soldering. Or else it will keep coming off.
Yes sir...
I am using it...
Noted
Good job. Did you get capacitors.?
Yes sir... Whatever you wrote in chat and a capacitor box
Sir .. i did series connection
Voltage output is same
Current output has increased
Huh.
From 10 milli amps to 35-50
The voltage has to change as well.
Check again. I will go some work here too.
* do some work
The voltage will not be enough for charging the mobile in that case.
I see what's happening in the video. Maybe the pressing is not in sync ( possibly )
Yes sir... In sync it went to 24
Just now
Ah
So the voltage went to 24
Yes sir sending the video
Do slowly
So if 1 piezo generates around 5v, second should. generate around 8 to 10v.
How is it showing 24 ?? Just curious.
Don't know sir üòÖ
Nice, I saw 23v. That's good. But how so high.
Save these videos in Google photos and make an album. Share the link.
I need to see historical data.
Yes sir...
Now, add the capacitor.  I think you bought 16v cap
Yes sir
I had requested it last week.
Yes sir i have them
Now add it and see if it lights an led
Dont charge mobile yet.
You will burn it
Also led needs 220ohm in series.
A single piece only lit a green led partially
On 31st
Dont plug the led direct,  or else smokes for 23v.
Okay sir...
Yes. Am aware , but with 23v the led will rip out. Careful.
Okay sir..
Good progress.
Thank you sir.. I'll try adding capacitor and resistance then inform you with the progess...

Saw it. Good - Thanks
You are working at 10PM - Inspiring :)
üëç
Go for it.
https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Series-connection-of-two-piezoelectric-plates-b-Parallel-connection-of-two_fig1_254863833
V= V1 + V2 .
So, if the first one was producing 3.3v ( from your "Single transducer output") video, and with 2 ( in sync-pressed video) was 23.5v.

Does it mean ( 23.5 - 3.3v ) = 20.2 is from  v2.
I'm not sure if I am ready to take that yet.
A single piece went upto six üòÖ
You'll se 5.8.... in starting... But i don't know sir how it reached 23..
üòÖ
1. Make a fork ( out of paper or straw or some solid wood stick ) and use it to press both at the same time ( Same person should click it ), I don't want 4 fingers or 3 fingers experimenting. it.

2. https://projecthub.arduino.cc/sadreactonly/fa2bf887-2bcd-4334-b3ce-8ab673d44943

In this they connect the output from the sensor/transducer) to the analog pin of the Arduino, This is another way of doing it.
Take time to do it.

line 40 :
Let me know when you are free, I can help with Arduino. It takes 1/2 hr or so to get started and then its sail thru. You will get addicted and not want to let it go.
Im off now.
I am referring some videos from yt now on Arduino
This is where the problem lies... Convening that it will work
She's the reviewer
*convincing
Good night sir.. Thanks for helping out
Be careful when you are working with professors.  You are referring voltage as unit of current. !! So thats why she was unsure of your answer. Think for a minute and then write. Dont jump at results ..excited.
You have to be first convinced with your results.
For now continue, set up an Arduino that way you dont have to rely on MM.
Yes sir
None of the videos show a negative voltage ? How come. I thought in theory it produces both a Positive and a Negative voltage and here it does not !( which comes to - do you need a diode )
Just keep it in mind.
You will need a Bridge rectifier to remove it. You will do it when you get to it. Just saying.

How to collect data from Piezo transducer output to Arduino's Analog pins.

```
https://projecthub.arduino.cc/sadreactonly/fa2bf887-2bcd-4334-b3ce-8ab673d44943

#include <Servo.h>

// DFPlayer 
#define BUSYPIN 2
#define VOLUME_INITIAL   20

//Piezoelectric
#define PIEZO_PIN A0
#define THRESHOLD 70

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
   
}

void   loop() {

  //Read piezoelectric
  int val= analogRead(PIEZO_PIN);
   delay(100);

  // Check that the piezo is pressed
  if (val >= THRESHOLD)
   {
  }

}

```
